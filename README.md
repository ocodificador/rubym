## Disclaimer ##

RubyM is still in development and its interface may change in future
versions. Use in production at your own risk.

## Summary and Info ##

RubyM will be an open source addon module for Ruby that integrates it
with the [GT.M][] database, providing in-process access to GT.M's database
from Ruby, via GT.M's C call-in interface. From Ruby I hope perform the
basic primitive global database handling operations and also invoke GT.M/Mumps
functions.
